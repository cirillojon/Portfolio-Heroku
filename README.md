# My Portfolio Website

Welcome to my portfolio website! This project showcases my skills in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. The server is built using Node.js and Express, and the data is hosted on Firebase Storage. I've implemented several fun features and integrated various APIs to make this website engaging and interactive.

## Features

1. **Weather Fetcher**: Get the current weather for any city using the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api).

2. **Trivia Game**: Test your knowledge with a trivia game powered by the [OpenTDB API](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php).

3. **ChatGPT Chatbot**: Interact with an AI-powered chatbot using the [OpenAI API](https://beta.openai.com/docs/).

4. **Photography Gallery**: Explore some of my photography, hosted on Firebase Storage and fetched into the app using Firebase SDK and GET requests.
